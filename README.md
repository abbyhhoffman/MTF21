Master's Thesis Project 
This repository contains my Master's Thesis for a Master of Arts in Managerial Economics at the University of Oklahoma under instruction from Dr. Tyler Ransom (ECON5940). The goal of this project was to understand if gubernatorial election of the democratic party for states resulted in decreasing the gender wage gap.I have chosen to research the implication of gender on wages earned across the United States from 1994 through 2018 using data from the Community Population Survey. Often the democratic party is cited to have a larger percentage of female voters compared to the republican party. To better understand potentially why this occurs, taking into account which party more effectively combats the gender wage gap could result in changes in the continued pattern of political party voting in state level gubernatorial elections. Variables used were regressed on the dependent variable, log(wage). The modeling techniques used were a fixed effects model and logistic regression. To reproduce these models, run the script in the .R file found in the repository. Data was obtained from IPUMS CPS data and opened in R through the 'ipumsr' package. To run the data from IPUMS and Kaggle ensure that you have the ddi, data set (.xlm file), and data from Kaggle, Copy of Governor Elections, (.xlsx file) saved in your working directory.
